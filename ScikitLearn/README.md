<h2> Using Scikit-Learn </h2>

  <p>Scikit-learn is a popular Python library for machine learning. I have used it to train some classifiers to
predict diabetes in the Pima Indian tribe, The dataset is provided as pima-indiansdiabetes.csv. After data split, scikit-learns built-in machine learning algorithms were used to predict the accuracy of training and test set separately</p>
 

  <h3>I used the following Scikit-Learn classifiers on the Pima Indian Tribe dataset:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href='https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html'>Linear Regression</a></li>
    <li><a href='https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html'>Random Forest</a>
      <p>in addition to traing the classifier , and check the accuracy of that for the test and tratin sets, I have demostrated the feature importance and GridSerach CV fucntion in Scikit Learn library</p></li>
  </ul>
