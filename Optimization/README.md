<h3>Optimization Models </h3>
<p>Optimization is a key component of almost all statistical learning procedures, and can provide descriptive and prescriptive analytics. Good software for solving models exists but building models requires human insight and expertise.  </p>
<h4>Elements of Optimization Models: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Variables: <p>Decisions that the optimization solver will pick the best value for</p> </li> 
  <li>Constraints: <p>restrictions on those decisions that we make</p> <p>restrictions on the values of the variables</p></li> 
<h3>SVD Example in python</h3>
  <p>In this example SVD is used for image compression and then restoration: <br> <a href="SVD_Examle_Python.ipynb">SVD Example</a></p>
