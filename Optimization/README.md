<h3>Optimization Models </h3>
<p>Optimization is a key component of almost all statistical learning procedures, and can provide descriptive and prescriptive analytics. Good software for solving models exists but building models requires human insight and expertise.  </p>
<h4>Elements of Optimization Models: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Variables: <p>Decisions that the optimization solver will pick the best value for</p> </li> 
  <li>Constraints: <p>Restrictions on those decisions that we make and the values of the variables</p></li>
  <li>Objecetive Function: <p>Measure of the quality of our optimization solution (the quality of a set of values for our variables which we are trying to maximize or minimize)</p></li> 
<h3>Optimization (linear) Example in python</h3>
  <p>The Diet Optimzation: U.S. Army sought to find optimal diets for soldiers that could meet nutrition requirements while minimizing costs.  This analysis explores the nutrition and cost associated with 64 different foods to determine the optimal diet.</p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li> n number of foods, and m number of nutrients</li>
    <li> aij = amount of nutrient j per unit of food i</li>
    <li> mj = minimum daily intake of each nutrient j</li>
    <li> ci = cost per-unit of food i</li>
  </ul></p>
