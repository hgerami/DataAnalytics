<h1>KMean clustering, unsupervised method</h1>
<h2> 1) Image compression using clustering</h2>
<p>This project is adopted from ISYE6740 Course Homework-1,  where I used clustering algorithms for image compression. We were required to  implement the K-Means algorithm rather than calling an existing library or a Python package.</p>

<h2> 2) Clustering Challenge, offered by Sound QI Company </h2>
<p>The goal was to use an algorithm to guide a user on how to start dividing the data into geologically meaningful groups. We had to use one or more algorithms to suggest partitions/clusters for the seismic crossplot data provided.</p>
