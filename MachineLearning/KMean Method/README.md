<h1>KMean clustering, unsupervised method</h1>
<h2> Image compression using clustering</h2>
<p>This project is adopted from ISYE6740 Course Homework-1,  where I used clustering algorithms for image compression. We were required to  implement the K-Means algorithm rather than calling an existing library or a Python package.</p>
