<h2> Pivoting to Data Science: </h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
  <p>From time to time I had used Data Analytical methods throughout my work as a Geoscientist, 
  and I decided to step in this realm in a more rigorous fashion. I enrolled myself in my 2nd master 
  program, Data Analytics degree from Georgia Tech, in January 2020. I forced myself to learn Python, 
  R, JavaScript/d3, Linear Algebra and Statistics to do well for the whole program. I managed to complete the whole 
  program, 10 courses & one practicum, in two years.  </p>
  
<h3>Accomplished Projects</h3>
  <p> Here I elaborate on couple of Data Sciense projects that I contributed to, a few from the university program, and the rest from work or my personal intrests:</p>
