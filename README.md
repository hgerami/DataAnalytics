# DataAnalytics
<h1> Pivoting to Data Science </h1>
  <p>From time to time I used Data Analytical methods through my routine work as a Geoscientist, 
  and I decided to may myself well familiarized with this realm. I enrolled myself in my 2nd master 
  program, Data Analytics degree from Georgia Tech, in January 2020. I forced myself to learn Python, 
  R, JavaScript/d3, Linear Algebra to do well for the whole program. I managed to complete the whole 
  program, 10 courses & one practicum, in two years.  </p>
